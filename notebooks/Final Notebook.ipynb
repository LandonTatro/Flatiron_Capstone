    "We were tasked with providing Computing Vision a series of suggestions for their transition into the film industry. Specifically, we aimed to determine suggestions that could target higher levels of revenue and/or profit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The film industry is a creative and diverse market with several avenues to success. With the understanding that there is no one path to success, we aimed to generate insight into a variety of actions Computing Vision may want to take in order to carve their own unique path to success. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed several different facets of films and their relation to generating revenue and profit. These areas included genres, day of release, and experience level of directors. \n",

    "The datasets used for this analysis were:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - im.db (from imdb.com - accessed through sqlite3)\n",
    "    - tn.budgets.csv (from The-Numbers.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the IMDB dataset, the tables movie_basics, and movie_reviews was called and merged on the primary key, \"movie_id\". The values in the genre column needed to be split on every comma, as many movies were classified under multiple genres. The entries were split within the column, and then for every genre in the column, a new row was created with the respective genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a *Lord of the Rings* movie was classified as an action *and* adventure film, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows. The genre value would be \"action\" in one row, and \"adventure\" on the other. The resulting dataframe was trimmed so that it only contained the primary_title and genre column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the tn.budgets.csv file was loaded in using pandas. The financial columns were in a common monetary format as strings; this was rectified by using the \"str.replace()\" method, and then casting the columns as numeric. A new \"total_profit\" column was created by subtracting the production budget from the worldwide gross. This inevitably creates an *estimate* of the total_profit, as it is unknown if the entire budget was utilized. As a result, the total_profit is expected to be *at least* the current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use information that otherwise is not very telling, the two tables were merged with the keys being \"primary_title\" and \"movie\".  The merged table would pair the \"total_profit\" column to each respective movie. After the merge, the resulting dataframe had 6,452 entries (which, as a reminder, is *not* equal to the number of movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing back the example from above, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | primary_title      | genre     | total_profit |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Action    | 340000000    |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Adventure | 340000000    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data structure, it was possible to create box plots for each genre and compare them to one another. "

    "The datasets provided are limited in a collective sense... The tables needed to be merged to perform analysis on, but unfortunately they did not share many movies in common. Additionally, we analyzed movie genres that had over 100 occurrences within the dataset - which dropped genres like \"Western\". Ideally, we would like to have a more complete dataset where genres don't need to be dropped. Ultimately, we were left with about 1,500 unique movies despite one of the datasets containing ~74,000 entries. As a result, The amount of entries left with was sufficient to perform an analysis, thought it is important to acknowledge that the circumstances are less than ideal.\n",

    "#### Business Recommendation \n",
    "\n",
    "Our original business question asked: Does the genre of a movie have any association with the movie's profitability? From our analysis, we can now answer that the relationship between genre and profitability does appear to be significant in terms of reduced profitability. Specifically, there is a statistically significant association between genres and low profit within this sample of over 600 movies. However, this association is weak, meaning that there is no guarantee that choosing to produce a movie of a specific genre with lower proportions of low profit will absolutely prevent the movie's profit from falling below the 25th percentile. Thus, our business recommendation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analyses suggest that action, adventure, and science fiction films tend to have lower proportions of movies whose profits fall under the 25th percentile. This suggests that it may be worthwhile for a company entering the film market to use this knowledge to guide further investigation into these genres as potential starting avenues for future work. If at all possible, we suggest further investigation into potential confounding factors that may better explain this significant difference, such as notable directors, production companies, actors, or themes. We suggest that this be taken as a loose guideline for furthur investigation based on the strength of this association. Trends are powerful, but not absolute. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results do not come without limitations. For example, while we did our best to ensure that the two tables were joined accurately, there exists the possibility that there exists a movie on one dataset with a title shared by an entirely different movie on the other dataset. However, with the timeframe provided for this project we have yet to explore this avenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the limitation of a relatively small sample size given the original sizes of our raw data. Unfortunately, a lot of movies had to be removed from the dataset during cleaning in order to optimize the accuracy of our output. However, similar studies with larger sample sizes would be beneficial in confirming the results of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the limitation of the strength of our results. Our small Cramer's V value implies that the association between genre and low profitability, while statistically significant, are weak at best. This is why our suggestion implies using these results as a general guideline to provide direction rather than concrete steps for action. "

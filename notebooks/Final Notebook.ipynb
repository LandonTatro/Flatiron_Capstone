    "The film industry is a creative and diverse market with several avenues to success. With the understanding that there is no one path to success, we aimed to generate insight into a variety of actions Computing Vision may want to take in order to carve their own unique path to success. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed several different facets of films and their relation to generating revenue and profit. These areas included genres, day of release, and experience level of directors. \n",

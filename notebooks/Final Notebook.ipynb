    "The film industry is a creative and diverse market with several avenues to success. With the understanding that there is no one path to success, we aimed to generate insight into a variety of actions Computing Vision may want to take in order to carve their own unique path to success. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed several different facets of films and their relation to generating revenue and profit. These areas included genres, day of release, and experience level of directors. \n",

    "In the context of this project an experienced director is defined as a director that has directed three or more movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Computing Vision is a new studio that is just starting in the movie industry, we ***recommend*** that they hire an experienced director that has experience directing three or more movies since our analysis showed that it is likely for these directors to continue being profitable on the 4th movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to our analysis, experienced directors always resulted in positive average profit. While directors with less than 3 movies can also be profitable, however, going through a risk averse route and eliminating the factor of luck from success, experienced directors have proved to be profitable on the third movie and on."

    "One limitation that could be pointed out could be that there is a survival bias in the research, in which survival bias is defined as a type of sampling error or selection bias that occurs when the selection process of a trial favours certain individuals who made it past a certain obstacle or point in time and ignores the individuals who did not. In our case it would be selecting Directors with three or movies, and ignoring the ones with less experience. However, we concluded that for a new studio it is preferable that on their first projects that they take a route that is proven to be successful and taking less risks and that is by hiring an experienced director to direct their movies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another limitation is in the case of trying to recommend to hire one of the top 20 Directors in terms of their average profit and their expertise, a limitation was that some of the top 20 directors are in fact deceased. Deceased Directors: Boris Karloff, Howard Hawks, Anatole Litvak, John Frankenheimer, Charles Walters, Curtis Hanson.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in light of this limitation, a business suggestion here would be to look into these directors' work and potentially acquiring the rights to their work if possible and generate profit off of that."

    "#### Business Recommendation \n",
    "\n",
    "Our original business question asked: Does the genre of a movie have any association with the movie's profitability? From our analysis, we can now answer that the relationship between genre and profitability does appear to be significant in terms of reduced profitability. Specifically, there is a statistically significant association between genres and low profit within this sample of over 600 movies. However, this association is weak, meaning that there is no guarantee that choosing to produce a movie of a specific genre with lower proportions of low profit will absolutely prevent the movie's profit from falling below the 25th percentile. Thus, our business recommendation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our analyses suggest that action, adventure, and science fiction films tend to have lower proportions of movies whose profits fall under the 25th percentile. This suggests that it may be worthwhile for a company entering the film market to use this knowledge to guide further investigation into these genres as potential starting avenues for future work. If at all possible, we suggest further investigation into potential confounding factors that may better explain this significant difference, such as notable directors, production companies, actors, or themes. We suggest that this be taken as a loose guideline for furthur investigation based on the strength of this association. Trends are powerful, but not absolute. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results do not come without limitations. For example, while we did our best to ensure that the two tables were joined accurately, there exists the possibility that there exists a movie on one dataset with a title shared by an entirely different movie on the other dataset. However, with the timeframe provided for this project we have yet to explore this avenue. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the limitation of a relatively small sample size given the original sizes of our raw data. Unfortunately, a lot of movies had to be removed from the dataset during cleaning in order to optimize the accuracy of our output. However, similar studies with larger sample sizes would be beneficial in confirming the results of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is the limitation of the strength of our results. Our small Cramer's V value implies that the association between genre and low profitability, while statistically significant, are weak at best. This is why our suggestion implies using these results as a general guideline to provide direction rather than concrete steps for action. "

    "#### Datasets and cleaning\n",
    "The datasets used for this analysis were:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - im.db (from imdb.com - accessed through sqlite3)\n",
    "    - tn.budgets.csv (from The-Numbers.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the IMDB dataset, the tables movie_basics, and movie_reviews was called and merged on the primary key, \"movie_id\". The values in the genre column needed to be split on every comma, as many movies were classified under multiple genres. The entries were split within the column, and then for every genre in the column, a new row was created with the respective genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a *Lord of the Rings* movie was classified as an action *and* adventure film, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows. The genre value would be \"action\" in one row, and \"adventure\" on the other. The resulting dataframe was trimmed so that it only contained the primary_title and genre column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the tn.budgets.csv file was loaded in using pandas. The financial columns were in a common monetary format as strings; this was rectified by using the \"str.replace()\" method, and then casting the columns as numeric. A new \"total_profit\" column was created by subtracting the production budget from the worldwide gross. This inevitably creates an *estimate* of the total_profit, as it is unknown if the entire budget was utilized. As a result, the total_profit is expected to be *at least* the current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use information that otherwise is not very telling, the two tables were merged with the keys being \"primary_title\" and \"movie\".  The merged table would pair the \"total_profit\" column to each respective movie. After the merge, the resulting dataframe had 6,452 entries (which, as a reminder, is *not* equal to the number of movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing back the example from above, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | primary_title      | genre     | total_profit |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Action    | 340000000    |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Adventure | 340000000    |\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this data structure, it was possible to create box plots for each genre and compare them to one another. "

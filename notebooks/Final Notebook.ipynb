    "The film industry is a creative and diverse market with several avenues to success. With the understanding that there is no one path to success, we aimed to generate insight into a variety of actions Computing Vision may want to take in order to carve their own unique path to success. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed several different facets of films and their relation to generating revenue and profit. These areas included genres, day of release, and experience level of directors. \n",

In our case it would be selecting Directors with three or movies, and ignoring the ones with less experience. However, we concluded that for a new studio it is preferable that on their first projects that they take a route that is proven to be successful and taking less risks and that is by hiring an experienced director to direct their movies. \n",

    "    - im.db (from imdb.com - accessed through sqlite3)\n",
    "    - tn.budgets.csv (from The-Numbers.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the IMDB dataset, the tables movie_basics, and movie_reviews was called and merged on the primary key, \"movie_id\". The values in the genre column needed to be split on every comma, as many movies were classified under multiple genres. The entries were split within the column, and then for every genre in the column, a new row was created with the respective genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a *Lord of the Rings* movie was classified as an action *and* adventure film, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows. The genre value would be \"action\" in one row, and \"adventure\" on the other. The resulting dataframe was trimmed so that it only contained the primary_title and genre column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the tn.budgets.csv file was loaded in using pandas. The financial columns were in a common monetary format as strings; this was rectified by using the \"str.replace()\" method, and then casting the columns as numeric. A new \"total_profit\" column was created by subtracting the production budget from the worldwide gross. This inevitably creates an *estimate* of the total_profit, as it is unknown if the entire budget was utilized. As a result, the total_profit is expected to be *at least* the current value.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use information that otherwise is not very telling, the two tables were merged with the keys being \"primary_title\" and \"movie\".  The merged table would pair the \"total_profit\" column to each respective movie. After the merge, the resulting dataframe had 6,452 entries (which, as a reminder, is *not* equal to the number of movies).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bringing back the example from above, *Lord of the Rings* would appear in two separate rows as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    | primary_title      | genre     | total_profit |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Action    | 340000000    |\n",
    "    |*Lord of the Rings* | Adventure | 340000000    |\n",

    "Based off of the boxplots, two genres stand out based on their median profit: Animation and Adventure. These genres also appear to have the highest variance as they are stretched (or tall, if you will). \n",
    "\n",
    "It also appears there is a positive skew, as the distance from the median to the upper quartile is much greater than the distance to the lower quartile. This positive skew means that most movies, within their respective genre, had a positive net income, but some generate extraordinarily higher amounts. It is not to say that genre is an indicator of profit, but just an observation of the current data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are merely a surface level analysis, and therefore not conclusive. Going forward, we will utilize statistical methods to dig deeper into our observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Side Note\n",
    "Aside from statistical analysis, a next step could be creating a profit to budget ratio. Lower budget films with a consistently higher profit to budget ratio could be an worthwhile investment as a lower-cost entry point as new studio."

There were some zeroes in this column, presumably because there was no available data on its gross revenue. We originally removed these observations from the dataframe. However, we discovered later on that this resulted in a very small sample size when coupled with the unavoidable loss of other observations. So rather than removing these observations, we decided to replace them with the median once the column had been properly cleaned. We decided to use the median rather than the mean for imputation because this was a highly skewed dataset with outliers that would significantly impact the mean, but the median would be more resilient against. \n",

    "Our original business question asked: Does the genre of a movie have any association with the movie's profitability? From our analysis, we can now answer that the relationship between genre and profit is extremely weak. Because of this, our recommendation is to avoid seeking profit by restricting film production to a specific genre, as there is no evidence of a strong association between these two variables. Instead, we suggest additional research into potential confounding factors that  may target the aforementioned higher median profits in animation, adventure, science fiction, action, and fantasy movies. \n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results do not come without limitations. For example, while we did our best to ensure that the two tables were joined accurately, there exists the possibility that there could be a movie on one dataset with a title shared by an entirely different movie on the other dataset. Future research using data from one resource rather than multiple may help circumvent this issue and provide additional insight. \n",
    "\n",
    "There was also the limitation of a relatively small sample size given the original sizes of our raw data. Unfortunately, a lot of movies had to be removed from the dataset during cleaning in order to optimize the accuracy of our output. However, similar studies with larger sample sizes would be beneficial in confirming the results of this analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we imputed some values in our dataset to preserve a decent sample size. However, this does introduce potential inaccuracy in our results. Future research with more valid data could provide additional insight."
